# Vehicular Hazard Prediction

This repository implements time-series forecasting and classification models for predicting vehicular hazard attacks using the [VeReMiAP dataset](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/R09EWA).

It includes LSTM and GRU models for univariate hazard forecasting, as well as a stacked model that combines LSTM regression outputs with logistic regression for improved binary classification.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **LSTM Forecasting**  
  Time-series hazard attack prediction using a Long Short-Term Memory model.

- **GRU Forecasting**  
  Forecasting hazard signals using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model â€” a simpler and computationally efficient alternative to LSTM.

- **Stacked Model (LSTM + Logistic Regression)**  
  Integrates LSTM output with raw features to classify hazard attacks using logistic regression.

- **Performance Metrics**  
  Evaluates models using RÂ² score, MAE, F1 score, accuracy, and confusion matrix.

- **Visualization**  
  Time-based plots for actual vs. predicted hazard occurrences and classifications.

- **Export Options**  
  Predictions and metrics can be saved to CSV files; models can be stored for later reuse.
